		<h1>Team Canvas - Leveraging the power of a canvas for team improvements</h1>
		<p>v0.3</p>
		<h2>Motivation</h2>
		<p>
            Products should be developed strategically. If that is not the case than it is not product development but only fire fighting.
            For teams the same principle is true. In order to move from fire fighting to strategic team development typical retrospective tools are
            not enough.
		</p>
        <p>
            The Canvas is a good fit for this purpose as it is adaptable, visible and easy to use.
        </p>
		<h2>Introduction to the "Canvas" tool</h2>
        <p>
            The original Canvas is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas">Business Model Canvas</a> helping enterprises
            to summarize their business. This concept was further enhanced and reused for product development in the
            <a href="http://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-canvas/">Product Canvas</a>. Additionally the Canvas is starting to gain grounds
            for change management. An example is the <a href="http://canvanizer.com/new/lean-change-canvas">Lean Change Canvas</a>. Keep in mind that
            team development also needs change management if done effectively.
        </p>

          <h3>Composition</h3>
          <h4>Our vision</h4><i>How should the team be defined?</i>
            <p>This is the team's vision how they would describe themselves in the future with only one short sentence. I strongly suggest that the team
            comes up with one. </p>
          <h4>Target state</h4><i>How does the future look like?</i>
            <p>The target state describes the environment and traits the team has, when the vision is met. Examples:
            <ul>
                <li>Won Sprints are the norm</li>
                <li>New products are pro-actively identified</li>
                <li>A wide span of technologies is used</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
          <h4>Urgent</h4><i>What hurts currently the most?</i>
          <p>This is the place you can attach typical impediments happening during the Sprint. At the retrospective the team can decide if this is something which needs to
          be tackled "strategically" or not.</p>
          <h4>Actions</h4><i>What is done in order to reach the target state?</i>
              <p>Improvements are put up here. They should always have a connection to the target state. If this is not the case you should check if you need to
              adjust the target state or scrap the improvement. Examples:
              <ul><li>Introduce 10 % free allocatable time for every dev team member so they can choose what they are working on.
              Supports target state item "New products are pro-actively identified"</li></ul>

          </p>
          <h4>Success criteria</h4><i>How to check if the action is a success?</i>
          <p>Here starts the fun part. It is often very difficult to come up with a good type of measurement. If the improvement should reap only long-term benefits
          which can be measured, consider slicing the action or keeping the action on the board until verified/falsified. Examples:
          <ul>
            <li>Two feasible product ideas reach the Product Owner every month. Check for "Introduce 10 % free allocatable time for every dev team member"</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Success criteria</h4><i>How to check if the action is a success?</i>
          <p>Here starts the fun part. It is often very difficult to come up with a good type of measurement. If the improvement should reap only long-term benefits
              which can be measured, consider slicing the action or keeping the action on the board until verified/falsified. Examples:
          <ul>
              <li>Two feasible product ideas reach the Product Owner every month. Check for "Introduce 10 % free allocatable time for every dev team member"</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Verified improvements</h4><i>What action is a success?</i>
          <p>A place to put successful improvements. The goal is to have a hall of achievements and a reminder how the "process" looks like. There is no room
              for non-working improvements on purpose as this would invite exclamations like "It did not work before, why should it now?".
          </p>
          <h3>Addons</h3>
          <p>During the iteration the team might come up with good ideas for improvements. If you attach a sheet of paper right next to the Team Canvas the team
          members can add new possible improvements whenever they like. In the retrospective check those ideas and flesh them out.</p>
