		<h1>Using Impact Maps for planning and controlling process improvements</h1>
		<p>v0.2</p>
		<h2>Motivation</h2>
		<p>
            The typical outcome of retroperspectives should be process improvements. Books like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/721338.Agile_Retrospectives">Agile Retroperspectives</a> and
            <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9364936-gamestorming">Gamestorming</a> offer a wide range of ideas for conducting these meetings.
            To enable the team to envision improvements more methologically and strategically often used methods are lacking.
        </p>
         <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
         <p>As products should also be solutions to real problems as process improvements should be typical product development methods should also be applicable
             for strategically develop process improvements.
            Impact Maps are a method to strategically develop products or on a wider scale strategically deliver solutions to problems. So they seem a good method
             to try out.
		</p>
		<h2>Analysis of Impact Maps</h2>
		<p class="text-left">
            <a href="http://impactmapping.org/">Impact Maps</a> are composed of four different layers:
                <ul>
                    <li>Why are we doing this?</li>
                    <li>Who is going to help/hinder us?</li>
                    <li>How can they help/hinder us?</li>
                    <li>What do we need to do in order to enable/disable the "How"?</li>
                </ul>
            A more detailed explanation can be found at <a href="http://impactmapping.org/">http://impactmapping.org</a>.
		</p>
        <h2>Field test</h2>
          In order to try out my assumptions I tried it out with my coached teams.
          <h3>Setup</h3>
          <p>Two scenarios were created:
          <ol>
            <li>Impact Mapping is used for conducting the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/721338.Agile_Retrospectives">"Generate insights" phase</a>. The resulting Impact Map is not reused in the following retro-perspectives.</li>
            <li>Impact Mapping is used for conducting separate team improvement workshops. The resulting Impact Map is used as the backbone of future retroperspectives.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Please keep in mind that the tests were done with two completely different teams. So the significance of the outcome is lacking. The tested
            teams were Scrum teams consisting of approxx. 7 people.
          </p>
          <h3>Results/Insights/Observations</h3>
          <h4>Scenario 1</h4>
            First of all it highly depends for what exactly you are generating insight. In general you will have two types:
            <ul>
                <li>Problems</li>
                <li>Improvements</li>
            </ul>
            So similar to shopping lists in product development you are starting here with the same thing. You have a shopping list of problems or improvements. As a start
            work with the team to create a common goal (The <strong>why</strong>) for this Impact Map. Good retroperspectives should have a goal, so this will be easy e.g.
            increase the percentage of delivered User Stories to 90 %.

          <h4>Scenario 2</h4>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
