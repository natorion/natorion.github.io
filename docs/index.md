I am Michael Hablich and currently work as a Product Manager for Chrome DevTools and Puppeteer at Google.  In the past I worked as a developer, tester, agile coach, program manager, and engineering manager in various companies.

I am living in lovely Austria, close to Vienna.

I consider this page a playground to try out web technology. Cheers!
