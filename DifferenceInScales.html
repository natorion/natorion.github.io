		<h1>Duration, Effort, Size - Difference in scales</h1>
        <p>There exist several scales which can be used to estimate development work. Everyone of them can be used for a specific purpose and is not interchangeable.
            Although they can be transformed to each other with a bit of magic.
        </p>
        <h2>Estimating the duration of something</h2><i>How long does it take?</i>
        <p>This is often the type of estimation Management (with a big M intentionally) wants when they asked for estimations. The fun part is that the answer
        most of the time is: <i>It depends. </i>The reason for that will get clearer when we have a look at the parameters influencing duration:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Size of the task</li>
            <li>Amount of <i>working entities</i> working on the task (minus communication overhead)</li>
            <li>Skill of  <i>working entities</i> working on the task (how much effort can they pull of per time unit)</li>
            <li>Unproductive/Wait time</li>
            <li>Time spent on other tasks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So in order to create a good enough estimate for the duration of a task, the parameters need to be frozen at the time of estimation. This is
          a quite difficult constraint for long term tasks.</p>
        <h3>Example for duration</h3>
        <p>Let's model the question "How long does it take to transport one tiny package from Vienna to Berlin?":</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Size of the task: ~ 700 km</li>
              <li>Amount of <i>working entities</i> working on the task (minus communication overhead): one car</li>
              <li>Skill of <i>working entities</i> working on the task (how much effort can they pull of per time unit): 100 km/h</li>
              <li>Unproductive/Wait time: 2 h (heavy traffic jam)</li>
              <li>Time spent on other tasks: 1 h (one detour to Prague)</li>
          </ul>
        <p>So the duration will be 10 hours. This estimation is highly dependable on multiple parameters. If only one of them changes the whole estimation is off (a lot).</p>
        <h2>Estimating the effort of something</h2><i>How much does it cost?</i>
        There is one parameter describing the effort:
          <ul>
              <li>Skill of <i>working entities</i> working on the task</li>
          </ul>
        <p>This means if there is a difference between the estimator and the implementer this will have a (big) impact on the estimation. Here are some examples: </p>
          <table class="table table-bordered">
              <thead><tr><th>Low skill</th><th>High skill</th></tr></thead>
              <tr><td>Junior Programmer</td><td>Senior Programmer</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Car</td><td>Jet</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Small packaging machine</td><td>Big packaging machine</td></tr>
          </table>
        <h2>Estimating the size of something</h2><i>How big is it?</i>
        Absolute size is very hard to estimate if the numbers get bigger. It is easy to estimate if something is one or two meters tall. I will have a very hard time to
          estimate the height of the skyscraper over there. Comparing two skyscrapers standing next to each other is a lot easier. In a software project an absolute size
          would be:
          <ul>
              <li>Changed classes</li>
              <li>Lines of code added</li>
              <li>Function points created</li>
              <li>Acceptance criteria implemented</li>
          </ul>
