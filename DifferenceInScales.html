		<h1>Duration, Effort, Size - Difference in scales</h1>
        <p>There exist several scales which can be used to estimate development work. Everyone of them can be used for a specific purpose and is not interchangeable.
            Although they can be transformed to each other with a bit of magic.
        </p>
          <h2>Estimating the size of something</h2><i>How big is it?</i>
          <p>Relative estimations are a lot easier than absolute ones. For further information on this topic just ask your favourite search engine.
              The following examples are absolute size measures:
          <ul>
              <li>Changed classes</li>
              <li>Lines of code added</li>
              <li>Function points created</li>
              <li>Acceptance criteria implemented</li>
              <li>Distance between two locations</li>
          </ul>


        <h2>Estimating the duration of something</h2><i>How long does it take?</i>
        <p>This is often the type of estimation Management (with a big M intentionally) wants when they asked for estimations. The fun part is that the answer
        most of the time is: <i>It depends. </i>The reason for that will get clearer when we have a look at the parameters influencing duration:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Size of the task</li>
            <li>Amount of <i>working entities</i> working on the task (minus coordination overhead)</li>
            <li>Skill of  <i>working entities</i> working on the task (how much effort can they pull of per time unit)</li>
            <li>Coordination overhead</li>
            <li>Unproductive/Wait time</li>
            <li>Time spent on other tasks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So in order to create a good enough estimate for the duration of a task, the parameters need to be frozen at the time of estimation. This is
          a quite difficult constraint for long term tasks.</p>
        <h3>Example for duration</h3>
        <p>Let's model the question "How long does it take to transport one tiny package from Vienna to Berlin?":</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Size of the task: ~ 700 km</li>
              <li>Amount of <i>working entities</i> working on the task (minus communication overhead): one car</li>
              <li>Skill of <i>working entities</i> working on the task (how much effort can they pull of per time unit): 100 km/h</li>
              <li>Unproductive/Wait time: 2 h (heavy traffic jam)</li>
              <li>Time spent on other tasks: 1 h (one detour to Prague)</li>
          </ul>
        <p>So the duration will be 10 hours. This estimation is highly dependable on multiple parameters.
            If only one of them changes the whole estimation is off (a lot). This means you want to do this estimation as late as possible so most of the parameters
            are "fixed".</p>
        <h2>Estimating the effort of something</h2><i>How much does it cost?</i>
        There is one parameter describing the effort:
          <ul>
              <li>Skill of <i>working entities</i> working on the task</li>
          </ul>
        <p>This means if there is a difference between the estimator and the implementer this will have a (big) impact on the estimation. Here are some examples: </p>
          <table class="table table-bordered">
              <thead><tr><th>Low skill</th><th>High skill</th></tr></thead>
              <tr><td>Junior Programmer</td><td>Senior Programmer</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Car</td><td>Jet</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Small packaging machine</td><td>Big packaging machine</td></tr>
          </table>
            <p>As already mentioned it highly depends on the working entity how much it will cost. In software projects it is hard to forecast a long time
            into the future who will really do a task. So for planning purposes there are the following choices:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Developers are very similar to each other in skill and costs (interchangeable): This will not work out most of the time :-)</li>
              <li>Make the decision who is doing the work as late as possible: In Scrum the Sprint Planning 2 has this "task"</li>
          </ul>
