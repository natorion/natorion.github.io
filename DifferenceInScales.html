		<h1>Duration, Effort, Size - Difference in scales</h1>
        <p>There exist several scales which can be used to estimate development work. Everyone of them can be used for a specific purpose and is not interchangeable.
            Although they can be transformed to each other with a bit of magic.
        </p>
          <h2>Estimating the size of something</h2><i>How big is it?</i>
          <p>Relative estimations are a lot easier than absolute ones. For further information on this topic just ask your favourite search engine.
              The following examples are absolute size measures:
          <ul>
              <li>Amount of changed classes</li>
              <li>Amount of lines of code added</li>
              <li>Amount of function points created</li>
              <li>Amount of acceptance criteria implemented</li>
              <li>Distance in km between two locations</li>
          </ul>
            <p>Compared to relative size measures: </p>
          <ul>
              <li>Changed classes compared to ...</li>
              <li>Lines of code added compared to ...</li>
              <li>Function points created compared to ...</li>
              <li>Acceptance criteria implemented compared to ...</li>
              <li>Distance between two locations compared to ...</li>
          </ul>
            <p>So if I know the correct absolute measure of the comparison reference I am able to easily calculate the <b>estimations</b> for the other items.
          For example I estimate that the distance between Vienna and Berlin is double the distance between Vienna and Munich. I did a trip to Munich last week so I
          know that the distance between Vienna and Munich is ~ 350 km. This means the distance Vienna to Berlin should be ~ 700 km
                (it is ~ <a href="http://www.travelmath.com/drive-distance/from/Berlin,+Germany/to/Vienna,+Austria">690 km</a> by the way).</p>
            <p>In the end the size will not change over time if the system in which the estimated things are existing is not changing. So the distance between
            Vienna and Berlin will very unlikely change in the near future as Earth (the system where Vienna and Berlin are existing) is very stable.
            Let's compare that to a software feature. It is best-practice to build a software architecture as changeable/adaptable as possible. So in a
            optimal scenario the system is changing quite fast. As a result the "correctness" of the size estimates will decline quite fast. This is the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_of_Uncertainty">Cone of Uncertainty</a>. This means if you have a
                often changing system and need to estimates for a lot of stuff which will be done in the future, better use empirical data than these estimates.
                See the chart below for a visualization of this.

        <h2>Estimating the effort of something</h2><i>How much does it cost?</i>
        There are two parameter describing the effort:
          <ul>
              <li>Skill of <i>working entities</i> working on the task</li>
              <li>Size of the task</li>
          </ul>
        <p>This means if there is a difference between the estimator and the implementer this will have a (big) impact on the estimation. Here are some examples: </p>
          <table class="table table-bordered">
              <thead><tr><th>Low skill</th><th>High skill</th></tr></thead>
              <tr><td>Junior Programmer</td><td>Senior Programmer</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Car</td><td>Jet</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Small packaging machine</td><td>Big packaging machine</td></tr>
          </table>
            <p>As already mentioned it highly depends on the working entity how much it will cost. In software projects it is hard to forecast a long time
            into the future who will really do a task. So for planning purposes there are the following choices:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Developers are very similar to each other in skill and costs (interchangeable): This will not work out most of the time :-)</li>
              <li>Make the decision who is doing the work as late as possible: In Scrum the Sprint Planning 2 has this "task"</li>
          </ul>


          <h2>Estimating the duration of something</h2><i>How long does it take?</i>
          <p>This is often the type of estimation Management (with a big M intentionally) wants when they asked for estimations. The fun part is that the answer
              most of the time is: <i>It depends. </i>The reason for that will get clearer when we have a look at the parameters influencing duration:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Size of the task</li>
              <li>Amount of <i>working entities</i> working on the task (minus coordination overhead)</li>
              <li>Skill of  <i>working entities</i> working on the task (how much effort can they pull of per time unit)</li>
              <li>Coordination overhead</li>
              <li>Unproductive/Wait time</li>
              <li>Time spent on other tasks</li>
          </ul>
          <p>So in order to create a good enough estimate for the duration of a task, the parameters need to be frozen at the time of estimation. This is
              a quite difficult constraint for long term tasks.</p>
          <h3>Example for duration</h3>
          <p>Let's model the question "How long does it take to transport one tiny package from Vienna to Berlin?":</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Size of the task: ~ 700 km</li>
              <li>Amount of <i>working entities</i> working on the task (minus communication overhead): one car</li>
              <li>Skill of <i>working entities</i> working on the task (how much effort can they pull of per time unit): 100 km/h</li>
              <li>Unproductive/Wait time: 2 h (heavy traffic jam)</li>
              <li>Time spent on other tasks: 1 h (one detour to Prague)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>So the duration will be 10 hours. This estimation is highly dependable on multiple parameters.
              If only one of them changes the whole estimation is off (a lot). This means you want to do this estimation as late as possible so most of the parameters
              are "fixed".</p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Estimates deteriorate over time. Additionally the more parameters are to be considered for an estimate the more energy is
              needed to come up with a meaningful estimate. In general this is an ordering of estimates by their generated value/knowledge: </p>
          <ol>
              <li>Size estimates</li>
              <li>Effort estimates</li>
              <li>Duration estimates</li>
          </ol>
          <p>So think of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto Principle</a> next time you need estimates :-).</p>
